# Fixtures

A fixture is the disposable app the benchmark puts the agent inside. It is a small React project
that already knows how to consume one design system, with a single blank file for the agent to fill
in:

```tsx
// src/task/index.tsx, as shipped
export function TaskScreen() {
  // Implement the task here.
  return null;
}
```

The agent receives an intent-level task prompt, writes that file, and the harness diffs it against
the blank version. Every graded dimension reads that diff. Nothing else in the workspace is the
agent's work, which is why the fixture has to be set up correctly before a run means anything: you
are measuring the agent's use of the design system, not its ability to configure a build.

Each cell gets its own throwaway copy. `node_modules` is symlinked in from the template rather than
reinstalled, and `prune` deletes the copies when you are done. This directory holds the moulds, not
the castings.

## What ships, and what stays local

| Template | Consume mode | Shipped |
|---|---|---|
| `source-app` | `source` - aliases the fixture straight at the system's source directory, no build step | yes |
| `npm-app` | `npm` - installs the published package into a prepared workspace | yes |
| `custom-elements-app` | `source`, for systems that ship web components | yes |
| `custom-elements-angular-app` | `source`, for web-component systems consumed from Angular (`"framework": "angular"`) | yes |
| anything else | either | **no, gitignored** |

`custom-elements-app` is picked automatically when a system declares
`"componentModel": "custom-elements"`. See "Systems that ship web components" below for why it
cannot be the React template with different aliases.

A template written for a specific design system encodes that system's repository layout: where its
components live, which React version it pins, whether it uses Tailwind, which ambient declarations
its source needs. That is a description of a private repo, and it is useless to anyone else. So
`.gitignore` keeps the generic templates and ignores every other directory here. A new generic
template has to be added to that allowlist explicitly, or it is silently untracked.

If you need your own, copy the generic one and keep it local:

```bash
cp -r fixtures/source-app fixtures/<your-system>-app
```

Then point at it from your system's entry in `systems.config.json`:

```json
"fixtureTemplate": "fixtures/<your-system>-app"
```

## Placeholders

At provision time the harness substitutes these placeholders across `vite.config.ts`,
`tsconfig.json`, `index.html`, `src/App.tsx`, `src/main.tsx` and `src/system-module.d.ts`:

| Placeholder | Filled with |
|---|---|
| `__SYSTEM_ROOT__` | absolute path to the design system checkout, forward slashes on every platform |
| `__COMPONENTS_PKG__` | `componentsPkg` from the system config |
| `__FOUNDATIONS_PKG__` | `foundationsPkg` from the system config |
| `__COMPONENTS_SRC__` | `componentsSrc` from the system config (relative to `__SYSTEM_ROOT__`) |
| `__FOUNDATIONS_CSS__` | `foundationsCss` from the system config (relative to `__SYSTEM_ROOT__`), or a harmless dead value when the system has no `foundationsCss` |

`src/main.tsx`'s foundations stylesheet import is dropped entirely (not just pointed at a dead
path) when `foundationsCss` is unset, mirroring how the npm-consume template drops its `cssEntry`
import when that is unset.

`__COMPONENTS_SRC__` and `__FOUNDATIONS_CSS__` mean `source-app` resolves whatever layout
`componentsSrc`/`foundationsCss` describe, not only `packages/components/src`. What still isn't
config-driven is a system's *deep-import convention* (some systems support
`import { Button } from '@scope/components/button'` with a bespoke subpath shape) and anything
about the repo beyond path layout — see "Getting a local template right" below for what else a
local fixture typically needs to get right.

## Systems that ship web components

A design system built on Stencil, Lit, or a hand-rolled custom-element registry cannot use the React
template, and not because of aliasing. Its exports are element classes, not components; consumers
register the bundle once and then write `<ds-button>` as a tag, with no per-component import
anywhere. Set `"componentModel": "custom-elements"` on the system and three things change:

**The fixture becomes `custom-elements-app`.** Still React and still JSX, because the mechanical
graders parse JSX to find component usage. But components are written as tags. It reads
`componentsSrc` and `foundationsCss` through the same placeholders `source-app` does, so it fits any
repo layout.

**`apiFidelity` stops requiring an import.** The default `react` model anchors usage detection on an
import from `componentsPkg`, which is what makes local aliasing resolve. A web-component system has
no such anchor, so a flawless answer used to score zero with "no design-system components used" -
the harness's worst-outcome signal firing on the best possible output. For these systems a dashed
JSX tag resolves directly against the catalog by name. The dash is what makes that safe, and it is
not decoration: `allExports` also carries the PascalCase class-name spelling of every element and
whatever the barrel walk reached, so resolving any catalog name would grade the agent's own local
`<Wrapper>` against an element's props.

**The workspace gets a generated `src/system-elements.d.ts`.** TypeScript rejects an undeclared
dashed tag, so every catalog element is declared as a JSX intrinsic with the attributes it accepts,
each carrying its real type where the catalog gives one that resolves standalone - a string or
numeric literal union, or a primitive. A type naming another symbol (`ButtonConfig`,
`EventEmitter<T>`, an inline object shape) degrades to `unknown`. It is generated from the extracted
catalog at provision time, because the element names *are* the API and no static template can know
them. Run `extract` before `run`, or provisioning has no catalog to read.

Emitting real types is what makes invented prop *values* visible. `apiFidelity` checks prop names
and never values, so typing everything `unknown` here left nothing in the harness checking them:
a first run against a real system produced `size="small"`, `padding="large"`, `state="info"` and
`variant="danger"` against elements accepting none of those, and scored 100 on both `apiFidelity`
and `compile`.

That last file is why the fixture's tsconfig deliberately has **no** path alias to the system's
source, only a Vite alias for the runtime bundle. Pulling a web-component library's source into the
fixture's TypeScript program compiles it under the fixture's compiler options rather than its own -
a Stencil library needs `experimentalDecorators`, for one - and produces hundreds of errors from the
design system's own source that fail the compile dimension on every task. Nothing is lost: a
web-component system's API surface is its elements, and those are fully declared.

One thing you have to configure yourself. The `a11yStatic` grader finds unlabelled controls by
name, and its defaults are conventional React names (`Input`, `Select`, `Toggle`, `IconButton`).
A dashed tag matches none of them, so an unlabelled `<ds-input>` goes unflagged and the dimension
scores near 100 no matter what the agent writes. List your own tags under the system's `a11y`
config to get a real reading:

```json
"a11y": {
  "controls": ["ds-input", "ds-select", "ds-toggle"],
  "iconOnly": ["ds-icon-button"],
  "interactive": ["ds-button", "ds-tab"],
  "childrenNamed": ["ds-toggle", "ds-checkbox"]
}
```

The last two exist because a dashed tag is lowercase, and JSX treats every lowercase tag as a
native element. Without them two checks misfire on correct code. `onClick` on a `<ds-button>` reads
as click-without-key on a non-interactive element, because the grader cannot know the element is a
keyboard-operable button: list it under `interactive` (declared `controls` and `iconOnly` count
already). And `<ds-toggle>Email digests</ds-toggle>` reads as an unnamed control, because text
children only name the conventional `Checkbox` and `Radio`: list every control whose slotted text
is its label under `childrenNamed`. A `<label for>` is matched as `htmlFor` is.

## The Angular template

`custom-elements-angular-app` is picked when a system sets `"framework": "angular"`. It is a
zoneless standalone Angular app whose `AppComponent` renders `TaskComponent`
(`src/task/task.component.ts`, selector `task-screen`), which declares `CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA` so
the system's tags are accepted.

It has two TypeScript configs, for the reason `custom-elements-app` has no source alias.
`tsconfig.json` is the program the compile dimension checks (`ngc -p tsconfig.json`, `noEmit`,
`strictTemplates`); it declares the package as an opaque module (`src/system-module.d.ts`) and never
reaches the library's source. `tsconfig.serve.json` extends it with the path alias `ng serve` needs
to run the real elements. The registry entry it aliases is `<componentsSrc>/index.ts`, as the Vite
alias in `custom-elements-app` is; a system whose registry lives elsewhere serves without its
elements, and grades the same.

## Docs and skills at the guided context levels

`agentContext.extraDocs` and `agentContext.skillDirs` are injected at the `skill` context level.
Two things about them are easy to get wrong:

**A skill has to land where an agent looks for it**, which is
`.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`. `skillDirs` accepts either a single skill bundle or a directory
containing several, and the harness tells them apart by looking for a `SKILL.md`. A path naming a
directory *of* bundles used to be copied wholesale, putting every skill one level too deep and
making all of them invisible.

**`extraDocs` accepts globs**, and an entry containing `*` behaves differently from a literal path:

| Entry | Lands at |
|---|---|
| `pkg/COMPONENTS.md` | `docs/COMPONENTS.md`, flattened to its basename |
| `pkg/src/**/readme.md` | `docs/pkg/src/**/readme.md`, tree preserved |

Globs preserve structure because flattening cannot work for them: a hundred files all named
`readme.md` would overwrite each other down to one, and an index that links to its siblings by
relative path only resolves if the tree is intact. Reach for a glob when the documentation worth
giving the agent is scattered through the source tree rather than gathered in a docs directory -
per-component API tables are the common case, and naming the parent directory instead would copy
the entire implementation alongside them. A literal path that does not exist fails the provision; a
glob that matches nothing cannot, so it is warned about by name instead. Watch for that warning,
because the run continues either way and the agent is the one left short.

## Getting a local template right

Three things reliably need attention, all of them the difference between measuring a design system
and measuring your own fixture:

**Point the aliases at the real layout.** Both `vite.config.ts` and `tsconfig.json` carry the path,
and they must agree. Vite resolves what runs; tsc resolves what the `compile` dimension grades.
Only tsc is graded, so a broken Vite alias is quiet - it costs you the dev server and the build,
not the score, and you will not find out from a run.

Two things about the Vite side specifically, both of which the generic templates already handle.
Build a pattern with `new RegExp` from the substituted package name rather than writing a regex
literal: a placeholder is replaced as literal text, and a scoped name's slash closes the literal
early, leaving the file unparseable. And list the subpath entry *before* the barrel entry, because
Vite takes the first match and a plain string `find` matches the whole prefix - `'@acme/ui'` also
matches `'@acme/ui/button'`, so a barrel entry listed first sends every deep import to
`<src>/index.ts/button`.

**Match the React major.** Consuming from source means the fixture and the system share one React
instance. A version mismatch surfaces as "two different types with this name exist, but they are
unrelated", which fails the compile gate on code that is perfectly correct.

**Include the system's ambient declarations.** If component sources import `.css` siblings or
augment a global type, those declarations have to be in the fixture's tsconfig `include`. Without
them, source files that typecheck cleanly in their own repository fail the compile gate here.

Only remove something from the template when the system genuinely does not offer it. Dropping
Tailwind from a fixture for a system whose consumers do not use Tailwind is correct: leaving it in
hands the agent a styling escape hatch that production does not have, which flatters
`tokenDiscipline`. Dropping it from a system that does use it would invalidate the run.

Record every deviation in your report's methodology section. Scores from a modified template are not
strictly comparable against a system benchmarked on the stock one, and the report should say so.
